# hello-world
Just my first repository


Hello everybody!
Currently I'm in a hurry trying to end "on time" my seismology activities from IRIS Workshop
I'm a student of a mayor in Geology in Colombia, in the future, I'd like to go further through statistics and geophysics, and also becoming a global citizien!
